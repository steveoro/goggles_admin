class DataImportSeasonBuilder < DataImportEntityBuilder

  # Searches for an existing Season given the parameters, or it adds a new one,
  # when not found.
  #
  # == Parameters:
  #
  # - <tt>header_date</tt> can either be the actual Date instance parsed from the
  #   filename of the datafile, or the unparsed, source text token (from the filename)
  #   containing the date of the meeting results being parsed.
  #   This parameter will yield the values for the current season and its fields,
  #   assuming the date falls into the most common range defining an academic year
  #   (which is from the start of September for the starting year until the following
  #    September of the next year).
  #
  # - <tt>season_type_id</tt>, when not specified, is assumed to be ID=1 (code: 'MASFIN')
  #
  # - <tt>edition</tt>, when not specified, is assumed to be 0.
  #
  # - <tt>force_missing_meeting_creation</tt>, false when not specified.
  #
  # Since Meetings data structure is deemed to be critical, the creation of any missing
  # link in the meeting data structure can be toggled by the dedicated flag.
  #
  # When enabled, this implementation searches and/or recreates also any missing row
  # up the season (included).
  #
  # === Basic Chain of existance:
  #
  #   Season
  #     -> Meeting
  #         -> MeetingSession (SwimmingPool)
  #             -> MeetingEvent
  #                 -> MeetingProgram
  #                     -> MeetingIndividualResult (Team, Swimmer, Badge)
  #                     -> MeetingRelayResult (Team)
  #         -> MeetingTeamScore (Team)
