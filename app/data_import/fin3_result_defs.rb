    # == Context type parser hash
    # An Hash of row type symbols pointing to an array of conditions to be satisfied.
    #
    # Parsing a row type implies detecting the context in which the tokens of the
    # row will be extracted.
    #
    # To successfully parse a row type (thus defining the current context of the tokenizer),
    # for each type symbol here enlisted, all of its value elements must result true,
    # equal or "satisfied", for the type of context to be recognized as "active".
    #
    # For instance, for the type :category_header, 3 consecutive lines of the parsed
    # file must satisfy the conditions inside its element array (respectively at
    # index 0, 1 and 2).
    # Whereas, for the type :result_row a single condition is defined as enough.
    #
    # If the condition is a String, the equal operator is used (=).
    # If the condition is a RegExp, the search operator is used (=~).
    #
    # Contexts are served in F.I.F.O. order (first detected, first served), but no skipping is made in
    # case more than one rule is found to be true (That is, one single line may return more than one
    # context of data, if the conditions are loose enough).

    # An Hash of row type symbols pointing to an array of arrays, in which each

    # boundary inside the currently parsed row.
    #
    # For each context defined by the row_types array, and for each possible row,
    # an array of conditions must be defined to detect the starting and ending position
    # from which the token must be extracted. (see ++TokenExtractor++ class).
    #
    # Use +nil+ or an empty array to skip token extraction for the current line
    # of context. If the "starting condition" applies successfully but the following
    # condition doesn't, the end of line is considered the actual token end boundary.
