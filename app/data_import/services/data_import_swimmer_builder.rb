= DataImportSwimmerBuilder

  - Goggles framework vers.:  6.075
  - author: Steve A.

 Specialized +DataImportEntityBuilder+ for searching (or adding brand new)
 Swimmer entity rows.

 Normally the automatic Swimmer creation procedure is disabled and requires a
 separate pre-analysis stage, with a statistical report of the best-match
 data before actual data insertion.

 For this reason, the +force_team_or_swimmer_creation+ parameter should be set
 to +true+ only after the analysis phase while processing the analysis result rows.


=== Entity look-up order/algorithm:
  1) Scan Swimmer to seek rows matching:
     - complete_name
     - gender_type
     - year_of_birth

  1.1) If not found, scan DataImportSwimmer to seek rows matching all of the above;

  2) If not found, scan for an existing DataImportSwimmerAlias; any candidate is
     fuzzy-matched against a FuzzyStringMatcher::BIAS_SCORE_BEST seeked name;

  3) If not found, scan Swimmer with some fuzzy-logic metric to seek for a
     "best-match", but using a very-high bias score (>= 0.98).
     This should be the last resort, since a positive match could be wrong
     anyway if the bias is not high enough.

  4) If all else fails, insert a new Swimmer ONLY if the force creation flag has been
     set to true (force_team_or_swimmer_creation).
     Else, save the analysis' result and return +nil+, thus signaling the need of
     a manual review/selection of the candidates found.

class DataImportSwimmerBuilder < DataImportEntityBuilder

  # Searches for an existing Swimmer given the parameters, or it adds a new one,
  # if no matches are found.
  #
  # The +category_type+ parameter is not required, but it may be used to retrieve or
  # confirm the birth year of the seeked swimmer.
  # In some remotely used datafile formats, it may be possibile to find a +nil+
  # year of birth for the current swimmer, with the only reference to his/her own
  # category.  In these cases, a custom search is performed using the age range of
  # the category; if no existing swimmer in the specified age range is found (with
  # same name and gender), then year_of_birth is marked as "guessed" and it must be
  # treated accordingly by all other classes referencing to this row.
  #
  # == Returns
  # +nil+ in case of invalid parameters
  # #result_id as:
  #     - positive (#id) for a freshly added row into DataImportSwimmer;
  #     - negative (- #id) for a matching existing or commited row in Swimmer;
  #     - 0 on error/unable to process.
