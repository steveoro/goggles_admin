= TeamAnalysisReportDAO

  - Goggles framework vers.:  6.075
  - author: Steve A.

 DAO class containing the fields composed during the "name analysis" phase
 of the data-import procedure.

 Mainly used internally just by the name analyzer class itself before serializing
 the values on a dedicated data-import table.

 === Members:

 - swimmer_match: highest-scoring match resulted from the swimmer scanning, a single
                  Hash with structure {:row, :score}.
                  +nil+ when no existing Swimmer was found in the results or there was
                  no traceable link to any of them.

 - swimmer_id: commodity id from the row above (may, in fact, not be the same, depending
               on the "best match"). +nil+ when no existing Swimmer was found in the results.

 - hiscoring_match: absolute highest scoring match (same Hash structure as above).

 - best_match: best match (as always, {:row, :score}), defined when special strategy
               conditions may apply.

 - text_log: resulting verbose text log of the analysis (never +nil+).
