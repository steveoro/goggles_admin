= DataImportTeamBuilder

  - Goggles framework vers.:  6.075
  - author: Steve A.

 Specialized +DataImportEntityBuilder+ for searching (or adding brand new)
 Team entity rows.

 Normally the automatic Team creation procedure is disabled and requires a
 separate pre-analysis stage, with a statistical report of the best-match
 data before actual data insertion.

 For this reason, the +force_team_or_swimmer_creation+ parameter should be set
 to +true+ only after the analysis phase while processing the analysis result rows.

=== Entity look-up order/algorithm:
  1) Scan TeamAffiliation to seek affiliations created/inserted from
     previous runs, which allegedly should have name just like '<team_name>%'.
  => if found, Team must exist (due to validations)

  2) If not found, scan if the wanted 'team_name' was just inserted into
     DataImportTeam (due to be committed on next phase).

  3) If not found, scan Team with some fuzzy-logic metric to seek for a
     "best-match", but using a very-high bias score (>= 0.98).
     This should be the last resort, since a positive match could be wrong
     anyway if the bias is not high enough.

  3.1) Additional (*integrity*) check on TeamAffiliation:
     If a Team was found, we can actually create at this point the missing
     TeamAffiliation using the searched <team_name>.
     (NOTE: THIS IS THE ONLY STAGE AND SITUATION IN WHICH TeamAffiliations are
      added when missing because their corresponding Team is already found!
      During phase 3 TeamAffiliations are _always_ added because all the Teams
      processed there are considered as "new" or missing.)

  4) If all else fails, insert a new Team ONLY if the force creation flag has been
     set to true (force_team_or_swimmer_creation).
     Else, save the analysis' result and return +nil+, thus signaling the need of
     a manual review/selection of the candidates found.
