= SwimmerMerger

  - Goggles framework vers.:  6.075
  - author: Steve A.

  Service class delegated to merge a source/slave Swimmer into a destination/master one.

  The source Swimmer will become a name-alias of the destionation.
  All linked entities and sub-entities will refer to the 'master' Swimmer after the
  process.
  Thus the process itself is quite irreversible for the destination DB and a backup
  is strongly recommended before proceeding.


=== Typical usage:

 - create and memoize an instance of the merger class;

 - launch the process (beware that it will modify directly the Database);

 - retrieve the logs using the member variables.

    # Regarding updates or deletions of :badge_id and :team_affiliation_id:
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------
    # These two have to change only if they refer to a duplicate row;
    # that is, a row that will become a duplicate (and it will have to
    # be deleted) once that the update (and translation) process has been
    # completed.
    #
    # Thus, each linked entity that has a reference to one of these
    # possibly duplicate IDs has to be updated with the new destination value
    # (of which they are the duplicate); else, the value for :badge_id and
    # :team_affiliation_id can stay untouched.

    # [Steve, 20131126] Having dest.Swimmer id overwriting src Swimmer id:
