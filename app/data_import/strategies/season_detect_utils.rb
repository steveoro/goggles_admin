  - Goggles framework vers.:  6.078
  - author: Steve A.

  Data-Import/Digest Module incapsulating all season detector utility methods,
  shared by the DataImporter class (for FIN-type datafiles) & by the CsiResultParser class.

  Extracted from the original DataImporter implementation.

  == Defines / assumes the existance of:
  - @full_pathname: the source datafile path name

  - @season: a valid instance of Season. Returned and defined after calling any of
             the included methods.

  - @header_fields_dao: HeaderFieldsDAO instance obtained from parsing the @full_pathname

  - @data_import_session: the currently processed DataImportSession instance

  - #append_to_log_file() method as defined in BaseTwiceLoggable

  # Tries to detect/parse the season of the data files by looking at the container
  # path of the files.
  #
  # This method updates directly the internal #season member but it does nothing
  # if it has already a value.
  #
  # === Example:
  #
  #     "uploads"  [ / ] "results.132"  [ / ]  "ris20121123test.txt"
  #
  # => This will force Season with ID #132 for all the files contained therein.
  #
  #
  # === Returns
  # A Season instance when successfull or +nil+ when unable to parse the pathname.
  #
