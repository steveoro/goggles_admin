= TeamNameAnalyzer

  - Goggles framework vers.:  4.00.709
  - author: Steve A.

 Service class delegated to analize the Team name matches.

 Produces a detailed verbose text log of the analysis as well as a list of
 "suggested" SQL actions that should be carried out in case the analysis is
 confirmed by human interaction.


=== Typical usage:

 - create and memoize an instance of the analyzer;

 - for each available team name to be searched:
   - call #analyze( searched_team_name, desired_season_id ) and get the result
     for the specified team name:

 - at the end of all the scanning a full text log and sql log is available
   by calling the dedicated getter methods.

  # Uses #FuzzyStringMatcher::collect_matches() to iterate until it finds at least
  # a single possible match, provided it has a minimum result bias score.
  #
  # All matches found and collected are described inside the returned analysis
  # text string.
  # Matches are collected in FIFO order, with each one selected having a better
  # score than the previous one. The resulting array is sorted on score.
  #
  # If no match is found or if a definite action is not possible, a separate
  # SQL-executable text is also returned.
  #
  # === Parameters:
  # - matching_string: the name of the Team that must be seeked
  #
  # - desired_season_id: the season ID for which the Team is supposed to be
  #   affiliated with if the affiliation row is missing.
  #   (This is actually used only to generate SQL statements in the separated log)
  #
  # - analysis_text_log: the string holding the resulting analysis log
  #
  # - sql_text_log: the string holding the executable SQL stament log, which
  #   contains any suggested action to be executed next. (Which should only
  #   be executed after human check.)
  #
  # - starting_bias_score: the starting bias score for the search
  #
  # - ending_bias_score: the ending limit bias score for the search
  #
  # === Returns:
  # A #DataImportTeamAnalysisResult instance.
